## Introduction

The Intent Recognition ChatBot is designed to recognize user intents and provide predefined responses based on the trained model. It uses PyTorch for building the neural network model and TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization.

## Features

- **Training Script (`train.py`):** Train the Intent Recognition model with configurable parameters such as epoch, learning rate, batch size, and feature count.
  
- **Chat Script (`chat.py`):** Interact with the trained model through a simple command-line interface. Get responses based on user input.
